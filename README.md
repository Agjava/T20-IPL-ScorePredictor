T20-IPL-ScorePredictor

The primary goal of the T20-IPL-ScorePredictor is to predict the total runs a batting team will score in an IPL T20 match by analyzing the match state after the first 6 overs (the powerplay phase).
The dataset, downloaded from cricsheet.org, contains ball-by-ball data for IPL matches, spanning multiple seasons  (2008-2017). The dataset includes features such as:

Match metadata: Match ID, date, venue, batting team, bowling team.

Innings details: Runs scored, wickets fallen, overs bowled, runs and wickets in the last 5 overs, and the striker/non-strikerâ€™s contribution.

Target variable: The total runs scored by the batting team at the end of the innings.

In a nutshell, I developed a machine learning model to predict the final score of an IPL T20 match after 6 overs, using ball-by-ball data from cricsheet.org.
I performed data preprocessing, feature engineering (e.g., runs, wickets, run rate), and trained a predictive model, using Linear Regression, achieving high accuracy. 
The project demonstrates my expertise in Python and Machine Learning.
